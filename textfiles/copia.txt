Hello!

I'm CSLuduena, but you can call me Sebastian!

Welcome to my portfolio. Here's a little about me, starting from my childhood when my parents bought me my first Pentium 1 PC. 
Since then, I've been captivated by this world full of connections and endless possibilities.

In this portfolio, you'll find my work and all my information.
You'll see that I'm an enthusiast with big ambitions, and trust me, I'm aiming high! 
There isn't a day that goes by where I'm not learning something new, no matter how small, I value it and incorporate it into my knowledge base.


I hope you enjoy browsing through my portfolio!


Best regards, CSLuduena.
